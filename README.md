#Bitcoin-Introduction.
By: Marcus Kruse.

##overview:

My first ever web development project!
It is a website with the title "Why Bitcoin is the best currency in the world".
The project is built with HTML & CSS.

It is a responsive website and looks good both on a phone, tablet and computer. The website look good while still basic. Colors are choosen to look nice and at the same time give the best possible user experience (while also aluding to the subject). All pages are structured the same way.

Navbar -> Text Heading -> Text Paragraph -> Media Content -> Text Heading -> Paragraph -> Media Content -> Footer.


##Purpose

The website is meant to be informative and helpful for the visitor. This is the website i wish i visited before i bought my first Bitcoin. It would have saved me alot of time and money.
By the links, information and the media provided. The user gets instant access to the golden nuggets i eventually found after alot of trial and error. Also if a visitor was to use one of my links the user gets a little discount and i get a little pay day, WIN/WIN!

##Technical breakdown

Navbar -> Text Heading -> Text Paragraph -> Media Content -> Text Heading -> Paragraph -> Media Content -> Footer.

Navbar located on top of the website one button for each page. Hovering over one will change its color, it also changes color to indicate to the user what page is currently selected.  


The images and the video breaks up the text to give the reader a break, while still being informative.

Building this website has been incredible.
I learned so many things along the way! For example that coding challenges and accually creating a project is two very
different things! Github, Gitpod, visual studio code. Saving repositories, writing commands in the terminal. I have come to
realize that coding is fun, addictive and rewarding and developed a new passion for technology!

My first ever web developement project.

So what is the use for this website? 
I give the user information and trying to spread the word of bitcoin.
Also i provide the users with my absolute favorite sites regarding the subject.
Myself never read a guide like this so i have alot of trial and error in my backpack.
By using this website the user dont have to make all the misstakes that i have made on
my journey regarding Bitcoin/crypto. The user instantly gets gets access to my favorite resources.
Also using my links will make me a little money and will give the user a little discount or a bonus.
So it is a Win/Win situation.


I did not copy paste any code but i wrote it all myself with the 2 resources mentioned below.
resources that i used for the code to build the website:
https://www.w3schools.com/

https://codeinstitute.net/global/

Also website that got my code validated:

https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Those three website is all i used to get this project done. Excluding the resources of Information
and media (these resources is anchor tags at the bottom of every page of the website)

In my opinion
Navbar is easy to use understand and see. i picked colors so that everything should be as visible as
possible. Internal anchor tags open in the same browser external tags opens in a new window.
