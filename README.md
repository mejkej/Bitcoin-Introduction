My first ever web developement project.

So what is the use for this website? 
I give the user information and trying to spread the word of bitcoin.
Also i provide the users with my absolute favorite sites regarding the subject.
Myself never read a guide like this so i have alot of trial and error in my backpack.
By using this website the user dont have to make all the misstakes that i have made on
my journey regarding Bitcoin/crypto. The user instantly gets gets access to my favorite resources.
Also using my links will make me a little money and will give the user a little discount or a bonus.
So it is a Win/Win situation.


I did not copy paste any code but i wrote it all myself with the 2 resources mentioned below.
resources that i used for the code to build the website:
https://www.w3schools.com/

https://codeinstitute.net/global/

Also website that got my code validated:

https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

Those three website is all i used to get this project done. Excluding the resources of Information
and media (these resources is anchor tags at the bottom of every page of the website)

In my opinion
Navbar is easy to use understand and see. i picked colors so that everything should be as visible as
possible. Internal anchor tags open in the same browser external tags opens in a new window.
